1. Installation

	1.1 Normal installation

	- Install Tcl/Tk 8.5 or higher, libtk-img, tcllib, unix_sockets and libsqlite3-tcl (read 2.2 for more information!)
	- Run: make install (or: make DESTFILE=mydir install)
	- Modify /etc/tbar/config.tcl to fit your needs or create ~/.tbar/ and copy /etc/tbar/config.tcl there, to have a user specific config
	- Run: tbar

	- To uninstall run: make uninstall, make sure to specify DESTFILE if you have done so in the install

	1.2 Starkit

	- Unpack the archive and run: make install (or: make DESTFILE=mydir install)
	- Modify /etc/tbar/config.tcl to fit your needs or create ~/.tbar/ and copy /etc/tbar/config.tcl there, to have a user specific config
	- Run: tbar
	
	- To uninstall run: make uninstall, make sure to specify DESTFILE if you have done so in the install

	1.3 Linux distributions
		
		1.3.1 Arch Linux:
		
		Check http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=37314

2. Feature notes

	2.1 User specific libraries, widgets and snippets

	From version 1.2 onwards, users are able to integrate custom libraries and widgets using folders located in their userland.
	Place custom libraries (along with a pkgIndex.tcl file) in ~/.tbar/lib, in order to make the libraries accessible to tbar. You will
	have to create the folder manually, if it exists, it will be automatically appended to tcl's auto_path of the interpreter tbar is
	running in.
	
	If you wish to install custom widgets on a per user basis (for your user only), create ~/.tbar/widget and copy the widget wrapper
	files to be loaded there. The widget wrapper file must be named after the widget, e.g. widgetname foobar would imply foobar.tcl	as 
	widget wrapper file name.

	From version 1.4 onwards, users can create small snippets and place them in ~/.tbar/snips. Snippets are meant to decrease the config
	file size. They should be used when a widget offers the execution of TCL code. Please check out the example snippet, located in
	/usr/share/doc/tbar/examples/snippet.tcl for more information.

	2.2 Automatic dependency management
	
	From version 1.4 onwards, tBar manages dependencies automatically. Packages are loaded on demand and warning messages are logged
	if a package is not available. tBar knows about widget dependency on the widget and parameter level. It will remove parameters
	from widgets, which require packages, that are not installed, thus preventing widget loading errors.

3. Widget notes

	This section contains special notes on modules:

	i3_workspace.tcl:
		This module requires the library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl-unixsockets/. Unfortunatly, the source was not
		compilable at the time this note was written, which is why you will need to obtain the patched source from:
		http://siyb.mount.at/tbar/releases/unixsocket_tbar_0.1.tar.gz.

		autoconf -> ./configure -> make -> make install

4. Misc Notes

	4.1 Makefile

		The Makefile supports the following parameters:

		EXPERIMENTAL - Effects the deploy option only. Will create a version containing the git hash of the commit, which was used
			       to create the build.

	4.2 Versioning

		Version numbering is not specified, but a version can be succeeded by a flag, indicating the state of the version. The following
		example will illustrate how these successing flags should be understood.

		1.4r1  - Release 1 of version 1.4. Releases may still contain bugs, if these bugs are considered to be critical (security, file
			 or system integrity, tBar not usable, etc), a release may be revised. The "r" flag is used to mark revised releases. 
		1.4rc1 - Release candidate 1 of version 1.4. A release candidate is a test version of an upcoming release and may still contain
			 bugs and other glitches.
		1.4e   - The e tag indicates that 1.4 is currently experimental, meaning that all work done on the experimental git branch will
			 contribute to the future 1.4 release (i.e. version 1.4 has no rc / r, but the contents of the experimental git branch
			 reflect the progress of the 1.4 release.)
